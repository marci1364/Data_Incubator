# Data_Incubator
This is a project proposal for Data Incubator program. 

Users: This proposal is for health professionals to assess the physical activity of healthy individuals as well as patients. Tracking physical activity and other health behaviors can provide a largely intact source of data about health behaviors in the free-living environment and can be an assistive technology when ensemble with other technologies like the Internet of Things(IoT).

Objective: My aim for this project is to detect the actions being performed by the user in order to monitor the level of physical activity a person is performing. Then, it can be evaluated by a health professional in order to measure if it meets the recommended requirements for that specific person. 

In recent years, deep learning has been utilized to address some challenges in human activity recognition. One of the challenges in this area is feature extraction that can be tackled by deep learning methods. In addition, the diverse structure of deep neural networks allows encode features from different angles. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable us to work with multimodal data or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for modeling sequences of data. These reasons have motivated me to approach this problem using deep neural network methods.  

Although deep learning models have proven to be successful in the sensor-based human activity recognition, they are usually resource-intensive. For non portable applications, graphic processing units (GPUâ€™s) are usually used to implement deep learning algorithms. But it is not viable for mobile devices. I plan like to address this problem by implementing quantization and network optimization to reduce power and memory consumption.
