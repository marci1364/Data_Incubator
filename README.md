# Data_Incubator
This is a project proposal for Data Incubator program. 

Users: This proposal is for health professionals to assess the physical activity of healthy individuals as well as patients. Tracking physical activity and other health behaviors can provide a largely intact source of data about health behaviors in the free-living environment and can be an assistive technology when ensemble with other technologies like the Internet of Things(IoT).

Objective: My aim for this project is to detect the actions being performed by the user in order to monitor the level of physical activity a person is performing. Then, it can be evaluated by a health professional in order to measure if it meets the recommended requirements for that specific person.
